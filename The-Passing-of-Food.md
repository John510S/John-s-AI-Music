Song: [The Passing of Food](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HebAxi6O5UaeRJ6XgtAcFBkFmNZziDjQ/view?usp=sharing)


Lyrics:

Verse
In the land where veggies grew
People's hearts they cracked in two
The sad day that all the food went away
Left 'em thin and lost in dismay


Verse 2
Tomatoes sighed and rolled away
Carrots dug deep tried to stay
The sad day that all the food went away
Hungry cries echoed through gray


Chorus
Where did the flavors go to hide
Empty plates plain and wide
The sad day that all the food went away
Our hearts broke on that same day


Verse 3
Bread and butter took their flight
Whisked away into the night
The sad day that all the food went away
Left us beggin’ and prayin’ for a tray


Chorus
Where did the flavors go to hide
Empty plates plain and wide
The sad day that all the food went away
Our hearts broke on that same day


Bridge
Whispers of a feast parade
Memories of meals we once made
The sad day that all the food went away
Hopes of plenty now decay
