Lyrics:


[Verse]
This isn't how you plan the night (oh, oh)
Chase the rain from noon till light
(dreams end)
Crimson on the orchard's ground
Trampling through, no one around
(whispered)


[Chorus]
Punching apples in the face
As the world seems out of place
Rolling down the path unknown
Crashes echo, heart of stone


[Verse 2]
It's a wild and reckless game (crazy)
Every bruise ignites a flame
(releasing)
Through the chaos, we will find
Hidden shadows, sweet and kind
(believing)


[Chorus]
Punching apples in the face
When life's rhythm's out of pace
Seeking clarity in the night
Through the madness, find the light


[Bridge]
Tired of standing still in doubt (oh, oh)
We'll break the silence with a shout
Through the orchard, we'll reclaim
All the strength we've tried to tame
[Final Chorus]


Punching apples in the face
When the world is out of space
Riding waves of electric dreams
Finding hope in moonlit beams


[Outro]
As the echoes fade away
We'll stand tall to greet the day


[Guitar Solo Intro]


[Verse 3]
In the orchard's twilight chill (oh, oh)
Let's dance till we feel the thrill
(play on)
Crimson paint from our wild run
Fading shadows chase the sun
(collide)


[Chorus]
Punching apples in the face
Breaking free, escaping trace
