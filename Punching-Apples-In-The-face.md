Lyrics:


This isn't how you plan the night (oh, oh)
Chase the rain from noon till light
(dreams end)
Crimson on the orchard's ground
Trampling through, no one around
(whispered)


Punching apples in the face
As the world seems out of place
Rolling down the path unknown
Crashes echo, heart of stone


It's a wild and reckless game (crazy)
Every bruise ignites a flame
(releasing)
Through the chaos, we will find
Hidden shadows, sweet and kind
(believing)


Punching apples in the face
When life's rhythm's out of pace
Seeking clarity in the night
Through the madness, find the light


Tired of standing still in doubt (oh, oh)
We'll break the silence with a shout
Through the orchard, we'll reclaim
All the strength we've tried to tame


Punching apples in the face
When the world is out of space
Riding waves of electric dreams
Finding hope in moonlit beams


As the echoes fade away
We'll stand tall to greet the day


In the orchard's twilight chill (oh, oh)
Let's dance till we feel the thrill
(play on)
Crimson paint from our wild run
Fading shadows chase the sun
(collide)


Punching apples in the face
Breaking free, escaping trace
