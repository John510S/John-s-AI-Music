Lyrics:


[Verse 1]
It started with a whisper from a voice I didn't know 
A haunted house on the hill, shadows in its glow
Invitation cuffed my wrist, as autumn winds would blow
Had a night to kill, with smiles that chill like snow
[Chorus]
Who's the host, who's the ghost?
Mansion doors lock tight, left with frozen hopes
Dancing with the ghouls, trust slipping like smoke 
Who's the host, who's the ghost?
[Verse 2]
Laughter spilled like wine, but the faces seemed so pale
Broken mirrors told a tale, of secrets held in jail
Silhouettes in corners, whisper truths too frail
Lured by pumpkins' light, but shadowed by the veil
[Chorus]
Who's the host, who's the ghost?
Mansion doors lock tight, left with frozen hopes
Dancing with the ghouls, trust slipping like smoke 
Who's the host, who's the ghost?
[Bridge]
The halls echo with a name, never once been spoken
Candles flicker, casting doubts never to be broken
Doors creak open to a night that feels unchosen
I'm trapped between the walls, where fear is woven
[Chorus]
Who's the host, who's the ghost?
Mansion doors lock tight, left with frozen hopes
Dancing with the ghouls, trust slipping like smoke 
Who's the host, who's the ghost?
