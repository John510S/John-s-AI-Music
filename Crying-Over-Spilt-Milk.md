Lyrics:


[Verse]

Momma why'd you spill my milk

All I wanted was a damn good gulp

Crackers dry and cookies stiff

Why'd you have to cause this rift


[Verse 2]

Table's wet and floor's a mess

Everything's just such a stress

Thought I'd have a snack divine

But you crushed this dream of mine


[Chorus]

I wanted to eat cookies

But now they can't be mushy

All my hopes ran down the drain

Momma’s mess brought nothing but pain


[Verse 3]

Shattered dreams over liquid white

Crazy thing to start a fight

Motions raw and feelings churned

Life’s tough lessons to be learned


[Bridge]

Spilt milk can't change the past

Why'd you have to act so fast

Memory stained in my mind

Anger's blind and undefined


[Verse 4]

Breathe in deep but can't forget

Milk stained tears still dripping wet

Time to learn from petty pain

Find the strength to rise again
