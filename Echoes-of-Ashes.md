Lyrics:


[Verse]

The amps roar, the shadows rise

Through the flames, I see their eyes

Guitars scream, the last reprise

In the death of death metal, no goodbyes


[Chorus]

Electric veins and thunder hearts

Tear down the world, rip it apart

No whisper smoke, no silent art

In death's defeat, we find our start


[Verse]

Silent chords, the fire wanes

Illusions gone, just empty frames


[Verse]

Drums pound hard, like war drums' call

The echoes shake the mighty hall

Bass lines deep, they rise, they fall

In metal's ghost, we stand tall


[Chorus]

Electric veins and thunder hearts

Tear down the world, rip it apart

No whisper smoke, no silent art

In death's defeat, we find our start


[Verse]

Ashes settle, the crowd moves on

The fire fades, the last song's gone


[Bridge]

But tomorrow's battles still await

In empty rooms, where heroes fade

Yet in our hearts, the music's played

A legacy that won't abate


[Chorus]

Electric veins and thunder hearts

Tear down the world, rip it apart

No whisper smoke, no silent art

In death's defeat, we find our start


[Outro - Piano]

In the quiet, a lone piano cries

Softly mourning, under darkened skies
