Lyrics:

Verse
I've got a giant sword in my hand
Cutting celery it feels so grand
In the kitchen slicing oh so neat
Making salad I can't be beat


Verse 2
Swish and slice vegetables fall
Celery chopping I'll take them all
Feel the rhythm feel the beat
Crunchy green and oh so sweet


Chorus
Celery samurai here I stand
With my giant sword slicing grand
Feel the music join my band
Chopping veggies across the land


Verse 3
No need for fancy tools today
Just my giant sword let it sway
Hear the crunch as I chop away
Healthy munchin' day by day


Bridge
Sword in hand and I'm ready to groove
In the kitchen makin' moves
Chop chop chop hear the song
Celery beats all day long


Verse 4
From the garden to my board
Cutting green with my mighty sword
Feel the rhythm feel the sound
Celery pieces all around
