Punching apples in the face, make it a pop rock song


# Test Album

Album cover(used Ideogram): Doggy holding a galaxy

## Honky Tonk Extraterrestrial
Song/Suno: Country song about hunting an alien

Image/Ideogram: Cowboy shooting alien with a shotgun

Comments: I just wanted a funny starting thing, so I thought of that stix season song. I mainly was going after a country song base to also test what the ai could do.

## Crying over Spilled Milk
Song/Suno: Write an alt rock song about how your angry at mom for spilling my milk, and use a line like "I wanted to eat cookies, but now they can't be mushy", also name the song "the use crying over spilt milk"

Image/Ideogram: Emo guy really mad at spilled milk

Comments: Thought it would be funny to create an angry teen alt rock song where he's angry at his mom for spilling his milk. Turned out pretty silly, and I feel did a good job at what it was aimed to do.

## Autumn Glow
Song/Suno: A beautiful song about autumn, include leaves, pumpkins, the color orange. Make the chorus catchy. Not a country song, more of pop.

Comments: I wanted some inspiration for possible songs I could create for my own music endeavors, but I wasn't to happy with this but it will work for this experience. The gola was to create a anice sounding autumn song, that was slow but not to slow. I couldn't seem to get the outcome I wanted so I settled for the final product.

## Echoes of Ashes
Song/Udio: write a fast paces rock song called "the death of death metal". End the last verse with a sad piano part.

Image/Ideogram: British Death Metal dies

Comments: I ran out of daily uses for Suno, so I went to Udio. Udio is kinda cool, cause Suno didn't have where you can interact with songs, it just generates it through prompt. The first prompt I asked Udio for I didn't like cause I wanted a death metal song, but it was 2 and a half minutes of yelling and didn't have the sad ending I wanted so I changed the prompt to fast paced rock instead this is what I got. Now what is really cool is it only gave me a 30 second song, so I used the extend feature, which gives you two extended versions. I chose one, and the song became a minute, then I chose the extend feature again and there was a thing where you can choose to end the song so I chose to extend it to the end. So it ended being 1:32 minutes long. I actually think the song sounds really good to, I really like it. Anyway Udio was really cool to check out. I recommend it. Also I don't know why but this song reminds me of London Calling.

# Fighting Foods

Album cover: Apple being punched in the face

Inspiration: Thought of vegetales and also thought of fighting for some reason.

## Punching Apples in the Face

Song/Udio: A song about punching apples in the face

Image/Ideogram: Apple being punched in the face (Just used one of the three it gave me from the initial generation)

Comments: When I first thought about creating this album, this song came to mind and I decided to use the same concept for the album cover. An apple being punched in the face is a good representation for enabling combat with food.

## Celery Samruai

Song/Suno: A celery samurai using a sword

Image/Ideogram: Celery with a face with a sword

Comments: So this one was weird to create prompt for, because originally I wanted to give the prompt "Celery weilding a katana", but for some reason the ai took the word katana as an artists name so I couldn't do that. So I just settled on celery weilding a sword that transitioned to celery samurai.

## Darn You Sugar

Song/Udio: A song about a kid being angry at sugar, use the line "Darn you sugar for rotting my teeth I'm going to send you 6 feet underneath"

Image/Ideogram: Emo kid yelling at sugar

Comments: I like the grungier songs, one because they sound good in my opinion, also I think the angst is funny. So this is just another alt rock song but this time about despising sugar in order to fit into the fighting food theme.

## The Passing of Food

Song/Suno: Song about the day food died after losing the war against people

Image/Ideogram: Cartoon of people crying at a carrots funeral

Comments: I wanted a fulfilling ending song for this playlist, like the humans won but at what cost? For the image it was hard to get down, because it would give me really weird real life pictures, and I also had to specify what type of food or it would get confused. So I specified cartoon to make it look better and carrot because it is a generic piece of food.

# Halloween Dream

Album Cover: Guy having a nightmare on halloween and the moon.

Inspiration: Halloween is coming up so that is the main inspirtaion, as for the art at first I tried dream but it didn't have that halloween feel. So I kept having to make it more specific, until I got what I wanted. I had to specify moon because I wanted the moon to be in there, I had to change dream to nightmare to make it no so happy, so it was an experience.

## The Traveling Pumpkin

Song/Udio: A pumpkin that travels at night giving candy to the good kids and scarying the bad kids.

Image/Ideogram: Cartoon of a pumpkin with a scary face traveling at night

Comments: Wanted a good generic base to start off with and what is more iconic to halloween then a pumpkin. I was thinking I was going to get an image of a pumpkin traveling down the street but I liked the image that I chose better. For the song I was going to have it be more graphic like the good kids get candy and the pumpkin eats the bad kids but I didn't want to make it to mean spirited.

## Dance of the Shadows

Song/Suno: Dancing scary shadows and how they steal your soul

Image/Ideogram: Scary dancing shadows

Comments: This song I thought was going to come off more scary then it did, but it's fine, I like it for the most part. The image was weird to get again, everytime I put dancing and shadows into the prompt I would get a picture of the shadows of a guy and a girl dancing, and it really didn't give off a halloween vibe at all. So i had to put scary in there to get something, but I was afraid the ai would make it to horrifying. But even when I put the prompt scary in there more pictures of not scary shadows dancing. So the image I used was the one image that fit the halloween vibe and I was still let down by none of them dancing. But it will suffice.

## Monsters in the Night

Song/Suno: Song about monster creeping in the night

Image/Ideogram: Scary monsters creeping at night

Comments: The image was not the best but it was hard to get a better one, I probably could have been more specific with the type of monsters I wanted in the frame but it works I guess. The best part about this song is the instrumental, the piano sounds so good in my opinion, I head it and I thought that even if the vocals sucked I was still going to use this track. The vocals were fine and sounded like a Halloween song so it was perfect.

## Who's the Host?

Song/Udio: Scary song someone who was invited to a halloween party but no one knows who's the host

Image/Ideogram: Painting Group of people dressed in formal attire wearing white masks in a mansion

Comments: I wanted to end on a more light hearted song, rather then having a scary song about monsters. I actually thought of a story that many forms of media use, I don't know where it originated from but I recall bu=oth adventure time and family guy used the concept for an episode. The concept was pwople were invited to a mansion and either they don't know who the host was or that there was murder among them. But I didn't want to do the murder thing cause I'm not sure how dark the ai would go, so I just did the light hearted path of not knowing the host. But I like the twist the ai through in there about the ghost. This is also the first time I let udio generate an entire 2 minute song instead of 30 seconds then extending it over and over again to get the outcome I want. I also used poe to help get ideas for this one as well.

# Closing comments

I enjoyed this project, I got pretty busy at times so it was a little hard to keep up, also I am proned to getting distracted really easily as well. But I think I created something here with the help of ai that represents me well. Some songs were fun to create and honestly don't sound to bad, while others I just wanted to get them over with because they weren't coming out how I wanted them. But I think I caught on well, I do wonder how much more I would have learned if I chose a different topic to focus on rather then music. From what I read of other peoples comments the bots had a lot more input and to implement then what I think my music did. But no matter the outcome I feel rather satisfied and may even come back to re-listen to the music in the future.
