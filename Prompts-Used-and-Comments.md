Comments: I just wanted a funny starting thing, so I thought of that stix season song.

## Crying over Spilled Milk
Song/Suno: Write an alt rock song about how your angry at mom for spilling my milk, and use a line like "I wanted to eat cookies, but now they can't be mushy", also name the song "the use crying over spilt milk"

Image/Ideogram: Emo guy really mad at spilled milk

Comments: Thought it would be funny to create an angry teen alt rock song where he's angry at his mom for spilling his milk.

## Autumn Glow
Song/Suno: A beautiful song about autumn, include leaves, pumpkins, the color orange. Make the chorus catchy. Not a country song, more of pop.

Comments: I wanted some inspiration for possible songs I could create for my own music endeavors, but I wasn't to happy with this but it will work for this experience.

## Echoes of Ashes
Song/Udio: write a fast paces rock song called "the death of death metal". End the last verse with a sad piano part.

Comments: I ran out of daily uses for Suno, so I went to Udio. Udio is kinda cool, cause Suno didn't have where you can interact with songs, it just generates it through prompt. The first prompt I asked Udio for I didn't like cause I wanted a death metal song, but it was 2 and a half minutes of yelling and didn't have the sad ending I wanted so I changed the prompt to fast paced rock instead this is what I got. Now what is really cool is it only gave me a 30 second song, so I used the extend feature, which gives you two extended versions. I chose one, and the song became a minute, then I chose the extend feature again and there was a thing where you can choose to end the song so I chose to extend it to the end. So it ended being 1:32 minutes long. I actually think the song sounds really good to, I really like it. Anyway Udio was really cool to check out. I recommend it. Also I don't know why but this song reminds me of London Calling.
